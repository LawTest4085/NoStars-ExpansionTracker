# Empire Expansion Tracker

Built for No Stars, a Sci-Fi Nation Roleplay (SFNRP) guild on Discord, this utility lets you track your assets and calculates how they expand over time.

## Instructions

DO NOT ENTER HYPHENS AS CONSTRUCTION NAMES

1. Open time_input.py. Run it, and follow instructions.
2. Go to items_control.py. Open it in your preferred IDE, and run it. Follow the instructions given. 
3. Open main.py. Run it, and look at the list of running items. You will have to manually go into items.py and items_list.py to remove any excess items, so be careful when inputting.
4. You are now all set to start tracking your nation-expansion. 

## Logs 

Logs are in the items.py file. Time needed means time from start.
